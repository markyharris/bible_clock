Touchscreen Instructions for Elecrow LCD5 display. Should work with other displays, 
but not tested anything else.

Strong recommendation: Do not bother downloading the so-called "driver" noted in various places. 
The version for Debian Jessie is really just a script that copies configuration files 
(that seem to have some errors) into your /etc/ directories that brick your device. 
Happily, there is no need to do this, you can easily modify the files yourself.

Prior to connecting the new display, do the following:

The only software you need is for the touchscreen. You can get this with "sudo apt-get install xinput-calibrator"

Then edit /boot/config.txt to add the following lines:
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
hdmi_group=2
hdmi_mode=1
hdmi_mode=87
hdmi_cvt 800 400 60 6 0 0 0
dtparam=spi=on
dtparam=i2c_arm=on

dtoverlay=ads7846,cs=1,penirq=25,penirq_pull=2,speed=50000,keep_vref_on=0,swapxy=0,pmax=255,xohms=150,xmin=200,xmax=3900,ymin=200,ymax=3900 <======Note this is all on 1 line!

dtoverlay=w1-gpio-pullup,gpiopin=4,extpullup=1
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Shutdown the pi, and connect the display. When you power it back up, you should have a perfect display. 
You can now calibrate the touchscreen by running Menu-->Preferences-->Calibrate Touchscreen. 
Click each of the four targets when requested and then you will get a text window which explains what 
you should put into a calibration file. For the Pi, the filename should be 
/usr/share/X11/xorg.conf.d/99-calibration.conf.

Use the touchscreen calibrator under Preferences in the Unix desktop to calibrate. 
This may or may not work properly.
